\chapter{LaTeX Hints}
\label{chap:latexhints}

One sentence per line.
This rule is important for the usage of version control systems.
A new line is generated with a blank line.
As you would do in Word:
New paragraphs are generated by pressing enter.
In LaTeX, this does not lead to a new paragraph as LaTeX joins subsequent lines.
In case you want a new paragraph, just press enter twice (!).
This leads to an empty line.
In word, there is the functionality to press shift and enter.
This leads to a hard line break.
The text starts at the beginning of a new line.
In LaTeX, you can do that by using two backslashes (\textbackslash\textbackslash).
This is rarely used.

Please do \textit{not} use two backslashes for new paragraphs.
For instance, this sentence belongs to the same paragraph, whereas the last one started a new one.
A long motivation for that is provided at \url{http://loopspace.mathforge.org/HowDidIDoThat/TeX/VCS/#section.3}.

One can write \emph{emphasized text (rendered in italics)} and \textbf{bold text}.

\section{File Encoding and Support of Umlauts}
\label{sec:firstsectioninlatexhints}
The template offers foll UTF-8 support.
All recent editors should not have issues with that.

\section{Citations}


References are set by means of \texttt{\textbackslash cite[key]}.

\begin{filecontents*}[overwrite]{\democodefile}
Example: \cite{WSPA} or by author input: \citet{WSPA}.
\end{filecontents*}
\PrintDemo{style=parallel}

The following sentence demonstrates
\begin{inparaenum}[1.]
  \item the capitalization of author names at the beginning of the sentence,
  \item the correct citation using author names and the reference,
  \item that the author names are a hyperlink to the bibliography and that
  \item the bibliography contains the name prefix \qq{van der} of \qq{Wil M.\,P.\ van der Aalst}.
\end{inparaenum}

\begin{filecontents*}[overwrite]{\democodefile}
\Citet{RVvdA2016} present a study on the effectiveness of workflow management systems.
\end{filecontents*}
\PrintDemo{style=parallel}

The following sentence demonstrates that you can overwrite the text part of the generated label using \texttt{label} in a bibliopgrahie"=entry, but the year and the uniqueness are still generated by biber.

\begin{filecontents*}[overwrite]{\democodefile}
The workflow engine Apache ODE \cite{ApacheODE} executes \BPEL processes reliably.

\begin{filecontents*}[overwrite]{\democodefile}
Words are best enclosed using \texttt{\textbackslash qq\{..\}}, then the correct quotes are used.
\end{filecontents*}
\PrintDemo{style=parallel}

When creating the Bibtex file it is recommended to make sure that the DOI is listed.

\section{Formulas and Equations}
\label{sec:mf}

\begin{filecontents*}[overwrite]{\democodefile}
Equations $f(x)=x$ inside the text can be provided.
\end{filecontents*}
\PrintDemo{style=parallel}

A list with all available mathematical symbols is provided at \url{http://texdoc.net/pkg/symbols-a4}.

\begin{filecontents*}[overwrite]{\democodefile}
As an example, the set of natural numbers is given by $\mathbb{N}$.
\end{filecontents*}
\PrintDemo{style=parallel}

For the documentation of editing mathematical formulas read the package documentation of \texttt{amsmath}\footnote{\url{http://texdoc.net/pkg/amsmath}}.

Equation~\ref{eq:test} is numbered and can be referenced in the text:
\begin{filecontents*}[overwrite]{\democodefile}
\begin{align}
  \label{eq:test}
  x = y
\end{align}
\end{filecontents*}
\PrintDemo{style=parallel}

The following equation is not numbered because of using \texttt{\textbackslash align*} as environment.
\begin{filecontents*}[overwrite]{\democodefile}
\begin{align*}
  x = y
\end{align*}
\end{filecontents*}
\PrintDemo{style=parallel}

The template offers \verb+\abs+ to enable the bars to scale well at the absolute value:

\begin{filecontents*}[overwrite]{\democodefile}
$\abs{X}$.
\end{filecontents*}
\PrintDemo{style=parallel}

The documentation available at \url{http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/help/Catalogue/entries/voss-mathmode.html} provides more details about mathematical environments.

The \cref{fig:chor1} and \ref{fig:chor2} are important to understand this document.
In the appendix \vref{fig:AnhangsChor} shows again the complete choreography.

%The parameters in square brackets are optional - e.g. [htb!]
%htb! means: Dear LaTeX, please place this image here first ("_h_ere"). If this does not work, place it at the "_t_op" of the page. And if this is not possible, please place it at the "_b_ottom" of the page. And please, please prefer here and above, even if it doesn't look so optimal ("!")
%These should NOT be used if possible. LaTeX's algorithm for placing the glide environment is already very good!

It is possible to convert SVGs to PDF directly during compilation.
This is described in the source code of latex-tipps.tex, but commented out.

\iffalse % <-- Take this away if inkscape is in the path
  The SVG in \cref{fig:directSVG} is directly included, while the text in the SVG in \cref{fig:latexSVG} is set using pdflatex.
  If you want to see the graphics, inkscape must be in PATH and in the text source \texttt{\textbackslash{}iffalse} and \text{\textbackslash{}iftrue} have to be commented out.

\section{Abbreviations}

At the first pass, the \gls{fr} was 5.
At the second pass was \gls{fr} 3.
The plural form can be seen here: \glspl{er}.
To demonstrate what the list of abbreviations looks like for longer description texts, \glspl{rdbms} must be mentioned here.

With \verb+\gls{...}+ you can enter abbreviations, the first time you call it, the long form is used.
When reusing \verb+\gls{..}+ the short form is automatically displayed.
The abbreviation is also automatically inserted in the abbreviation list.
With \verb+\glspl{...}+ the plural form is used.
If you want the short form to appear directly at the first use, you can use \verb+\glsunset{..}+ to mark an abbreviation as already used.
The opposite is achieved with \verb+\glsreset{..}+.

Abbreviations are defined in \verb+\content\ausarbeitung.tex+ by means of \verb+\newacronym{...}{...}{...}+.

\section{References}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
For distant sections \qq{varioref} is recommended:
\qq{See \vref{sec:mf}}.
The command \texttt{\textbackslash{}vref} works similarly to \texttt{\textbackslash{}cref} the difference being that a reference to the page is additionally added.
\texttt{vref}: \qq{\vref{sec:firstsectioninlatexhints}}, \texttt{cref}: \qq{\cref{sec:firstsectioninlatexhints}}, \texttt{ref}: \qq{\ref{sec:firstsectioninlatexhints}}.

If \qq{varioref} causes difficulties, then \qq{cref} can be used instead.
This also creates the word \qq{section} automatically: \cref{sec:mf}.
This is also possible for illustrations etc.
In English please use \verb1\Cref{...}1 (with large \qq{C} at the beginning).

%With MiKTeX installation from 2012-01-16 no longer necessary.
%If a section becomes longer than one page and you want to refer to a specific place in the section with \texttt{\textbackslash{}vref}, then you should use \texttt{\textbackslash{}phantomsection} then using \texttt{vref} will also display the correct page number.

\section{Definitions}

\begin{definition}[Title]
  \label{def:def1}
  Definition Text

\Cref{def:def1} shows \ldots

\section{Footnotes}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Footnotes are provided by the command \verb+\footnote{...}+\footnote{\label{fussnote}Example footnote.}. Citing footnotes is possible by provinding a label\verb+\footnote{\label{...}...}+ and cite the footnote with \verb+\cref{...}+ in the text\cref{fussnote}.

  Numbers (123\,654\,789) are nicely set.
  Either in a line or as a non-lining figure.
  The latter is reached by the parameter \texttt{osf} at package \texttt{libertine} or.\ \texttt{mathpazo} in \text{fonts.tex}.

\begin{filecontents*}[overwrite]{\democodefile}
\begin{compactenum}[I.]
  \item You can also keep the numbering compact thanks to paralist
  \item and switch to a different numbering
\end{compactenum}
\end{filecontents*}
\PrintDemo{style=parallel}

The words \qq{workflow} and \qq{dwarflike} can be copied from the PDF and pasted to a text file.

\begin{filecontents*}[overwrite]{\democodefile}
In case \LuaLaTeX{} is used as the compiler, there is no ligature at \qq{f\/l} in the word \qq{dwarflike} (in contrast to \qq{fl} at \qq{workflow}).
In other words: \qq{dwarflike} and \qq{dwarf\/like} look the same in the PDF.
In case they do not, there is an issue with Lua\LaTeX{} and the selnolig package.
\end{filecontents*}
\PrintDemo{style=parallel}
% Meta comment: The precise form of the optimal ligation suppression command may vary depending on the character pairs involved - see https://tex.stackexchange.com/q/28437/9075
