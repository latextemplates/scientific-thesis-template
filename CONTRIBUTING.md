# Contributing to the scientific thesis template

We welcome contributions to this template and encourage to create a fork, clone, **create a new branch** (such as `fix-for-issue-121`), **work on the new branch — not master**, and create a pull request.
Be sure to create a **separate branch** for each improvement you implement.
Take a look at GitHub's excellent [help documentation] for a detailed explanation and the explanation of [Feature Branch Workflow](https://de.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows#feature-branch-workflow) for the idea behind this kind of development.

Alternatively, you can just use the edit button if a single file in the web browser.
Steps described at https://github.com/JabRef/help.jabref.org/blob/gh-pages/CONTRIBUTING.md.
