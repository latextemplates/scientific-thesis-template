# Use CC0 as license

Each information published should take a license to clearly state what is allowed and what not.

- The template should be usable freely.
- The license should be an accepted one at least in the European Union and the US.

## Considered Options

* CC0
* MIT
* GPL

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: CC0, because comes out best (see below).

## Pros and Cons of the Options

### CC0

* Good, because allows the user to do anything
* Bad, because the license text is long
* Bad, because not as well-known as MIT, GPL

### MIT

* Good, because well-known
* Bad, because more a code license than a license for text

### GPL

* Good, because well-known
* Bad, because forces the user of the template to make available his text under GPL, too.
